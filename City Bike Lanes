## I've analyzed the City Bike Lanes dataset to identify 
streets with an average safety rating of 4 or higher.
These lanes have been designated as "Safe Lanes" 
based on their aggregated safety scores.


WITH avg_safety_cte AS (
SELECT street, avg(safetyrating) as rating
FROM CityBikeLanes
where safetyrating >= 4
group by street
)
select street, rating, 'Safe Lane' as Label
from avg_safety_cte
order by rating desc;
